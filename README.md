Object Oriented Programmingin Python 
What is the structure of object-oriented programming?

[Lab17 includes the Structures of OOP](https://github.com/lyamann001/Python-OOP-/blob/main/Lab_17.py)


The structure, or building blocks, of object-oriented programming include the following:

1.Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods.


2.Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data. Objects can correspond to real-world objects or an abstract entity. When class is defined initially, the description is the only object that is defined.


3.Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object. Each method contained in class definitions starts with a reference to an instance object. Additionally, the subroutines contained in an object are called instance methods. Programmers use methods for reusability or keeping functionality encapsulated inside one object at a time.


4.Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object. Objects will have data stored in the attributes field. Class attributes belong to the class itself.

What are the main principles of OOP?

1. Inheritance  is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.

2.Encapsulation is a mechanism we use to restrict access to members of the class or to access them in a controlled manner. The purpose here is to limit access to the member of the class, that is, to prevent interference .

3.Abstraction is the Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. The derived class can have its functionality extended. This concept can help developers more easily make additional changes or additions over time.

4.Polymorphism is the Objects are designed to share behaviors and they can take on more than one form. The program will determine which meaning or usage is necessary for each execution of that object from a parent class, reducing the need to duplicate code. A child class is then created, which extends the functionality of the parent class. Polymorphism allows different types of objects to pass through the same interface.
